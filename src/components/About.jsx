            <h3>Why Do Some Images Appear Missing?</h3>
            <p>
              Occasionally, you might see a placeholder image or missing
              artwork. This happens when the original source hasn&apos;t
              provided a public image or the artwork is restricted for copyright
              reasons. We&apos;re continuously working to refine our display
              logic to offer the best possible experience. In this event, you
              will notice this image instead:
            </p>
            <img src={nullImg} alt="no-image-placeholder" />
          </div>
        </div>
